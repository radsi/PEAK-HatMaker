# Peak Hat Maker

This program is designed to be hosted on a server and requires Unity to be installed on that server, but you can also use it on localhost. Uses unity in Batch mode to generate assetbundle.
You need to setup your Unity project by creating "Editor" directory inside Assets directory, then just copy the script on this repo there.
